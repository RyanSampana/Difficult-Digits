It is highly recommended that all python and ipython files are compiled using a computer with a GPU. All the programs are computationally intensive. 

The Ipython notebook 'Keras Experiments' contain all the visulaizations of our models.
Model0 - Model5_3.py contain all the code to run the experiment for that particular model.
All the pngs from the Ipython notebook are contianed in the folder.

If you are to launch the code please ensure that the x_train.bin, y_train.csv, and x_test.bin are located within this folder.
These files were omitted so that it would fit the submission size.
